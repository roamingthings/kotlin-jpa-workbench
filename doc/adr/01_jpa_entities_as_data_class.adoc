== In Kotlin JPA Entities are implemented using `data class`

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

Kotlin offers a special kind of class called a `data class` to implement data structures representing a part of a data
model. These classes help to prevent boilerplate by offering automatic implementations of some conceptual patterns.

=== Decision

In Kotlin JPA Entities are implemented using `data class`.

=== Consequences

Since methods like `toString()` or `hashCode()` are generated automatically care must be taken which properties are
defined in the primary constructor and which are implemented as properties inside the class body.
