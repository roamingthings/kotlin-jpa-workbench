## Mutability of JPA Entities in Kotlin implementations

### Status

accepted

### Context

Mutability of Objects is known to be error prone since everyone holding a reference to an instance can modify the
state of the object. This can lead to unexpected side effects.

For this reason the usage of immutable state is preferred. This is even more important when it comes to functional
programming.

Kotlin offers both _mutable_ declarations (`var`) and data structures (`MutableList`, `MutableSet` etc.)
as well as _immutable_ declarations (`val`) and data structures (`List`, `Set` etc.)

On the other hand JPA is conceptually taking mutable entities into account. Changes to the state of a managed  entities
are merged with the persistent state.

### Decision

Properties and relations of JPA entities are implemented as immutable fields and collections. This allows to benefit
from the framework.

## Consequences

It is important that entities should only handled inside the bounds of the persistence layer. Services that are
accessing entities must perform a mapping between the entities and the domain model as close as possible to this
boundary.

Entities must not be returned or passed in as a parameter by any component outside the persistence layer.
