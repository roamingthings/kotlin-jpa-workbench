== Properties representing JPA Relations are implemented in the class body

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

When using aKotlin `data class` all properties defined in the primary constructor are used by the generated
`toString()`, `hashCode()` and other methods. This can lead to recursion when bi-directional relations are
implemented.

=== Decision

Relations of JPA entities are generally implemented in the class body and will therefore not be used in the generated
methods as stated above.

=== Consequences

If a relation should be used by the generated methods the have to be overridden by the implementation. In this case
it has to be taken care of the fact that bi-directional relations between JPA entities could lead to recursion and
therefore a `StackOverflowException` when not handled properly.
