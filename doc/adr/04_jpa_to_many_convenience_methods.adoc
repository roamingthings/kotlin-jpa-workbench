== For JPA To-Many relations adding and removing are handled by an entity method

=== Status

draft

=== Context

When building a bi-directional relation in JPA the entities from both sides of the relation have to get a reference
to the other partner.

To-Many relations are implemented using a (mutable) iteration (`MutableList` or `MutableSet`).

=== Decision

In To-Many relation convenience methods `addXXX()` and `removeXXX()` are implemented to handle the addition or removal
of an entity to or from the relation.

The owning side of the relation (parent) is also responsible for setting or removing itself to or from the dependent
entity.

=== Consequences

Adding and removing of an entity to a relation must be done by using the implemented `addXXX()` and `removeXXX()`
methods.
