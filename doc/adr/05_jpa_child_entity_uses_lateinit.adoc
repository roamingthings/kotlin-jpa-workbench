== JPA Entities being a child in a bi-directional relation use `lateinit` properties

=== Status

draft

=== Context

Kotlin requires that a value is assigned to all properties as long as they are not declared `lateinit`.

Properties representing a bi-directional relation may be initialized shortly before the parent entity is available.

=== Decision

Properties representing the relation to an owing/parent entity in a bi-directional relation are declared as
`lateinit var` properties.

=== Consequences

If relations that are declared that way are not initialized an unexpected runtime error might occur when the property
is accessed.
