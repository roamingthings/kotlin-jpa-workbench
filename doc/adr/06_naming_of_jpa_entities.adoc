== JPA Entities are named 'XxxEntity` and in a `.model` package

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

A naming schema for entity classes and their namespace is required for easier understanding.

=== Decision

All JPA Entity classes are named with `Entity` as a suffix. For example an entity modelling a person is named
`PersonEntity`. The classes are in a `.model` package.

Both decisions should emphasize the fact that they are an implementation detail and related to a certain framework
(JPA in this case).

=== Consequences

The naming schema must be used.
